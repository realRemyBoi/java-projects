This is just a basic 20 questions game written in Java.
To play it, you will have to run the QuestionMain.java file.
From there, it will read in the big-questions.txt file, which is its database
it will use to guess an animal you are thinking of. It will traverse down the file
using binary tree logic and ask you yes or no questions. If it runs out of ideas,
it will ask for your answer and a y/n question for that answer and update the tree
accordingly.
